Step-by-step guide
Log in to your Binance account.
Go to your profile -> API Management page. Enter your new API key name and click "Create".
Binance will ask for a code from your email and a code from your authentication app. Enter the codes and click "Submit".
The new API key is now created. NB: you'll see the secret key only at this step, it will be hidden afterwards. Securely save it at this step as you'll need it later.
Edit API key permissions:
          For copy trading on Coinmatics, set the following permissions:

for copying Spot strategies, select "Enable Reading" and "Enable Spot & Margin Trading" options
for copying Futures strategies, select "Enable Reading", "Enable Spot & Margin Trading" and "Enable Futures" options
          For sharing your strategy as a trader on Coinmatics , set the following permissions:

As a Spot / Margin trader, select "Enable Reading", "Enable Spot & Margin Trading".
As a Futures trader, select "Enable Reading", "Enable Spot & Margin Trading" and "Enable Futures" permissions.         
          Learn more details about the Binance permissions from this article. 

      6. Save the changes by entering a code from your authentication app.

 

Done! You've successfully created an API key on Binance.
