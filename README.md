# Crypto-Currency-Back-Testing
Finding the best trading strategy to test, getting the data from Binance, and testing  using python, many libraries included

# Downloading the data will be using binance, make sure to have your API key before you start 

Many libraries can do the backtesting, yet the final one i'm using now is vectorbt, which requires python version less than 3.10 (Till now, mabye it will be updated later)
